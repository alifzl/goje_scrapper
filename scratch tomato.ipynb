They have a pre-adolescent girl who has to deal with this situation, and decide after all which parent she wants to live with.Asghar Farhadi directs, writes and produces this wonderful piece of art set in the mordern-day Iran and that is an important factor due to progress that we have seen in the last years in Islamic countries. As the story goes on we see how modernization in social aspects have arrived to Iran and how the people deals with it, but also how traditional they remain even for legal issues.We do not see this movie as a technical achievement of course, that was not the intention and neither was to make a symbolic complex film that would have different interpretations, as far as we know those are not the reasons why Farhadi made A separation. The whole idea is supported by an outstanding screenplay, every dialogue and every line are so powerful and well written, in particular the discussions of our two main characters and the conflict that involves Nader. The cast is simply the best not only our four starring actors, yes, four, but also the children are superb, we can feel with them, either is sadness or fear they are always believable.And that end, oh my god that end scene it just defines the title that is really important through the whole film because our two main characters always feel separated, distant and where they are together there are no happy moments, everything is a conflict. For me is the movie of the decade, all in it works in a perfect way, I felt delighted from that great first scene to that monumental final shot. It is so refreshing to see something from another culture completely different and feel so attached to it, Cinema is a universal language that make us feel alive and A separation is the living proof for that. 10/10\"], ['Kyle M', 'Mar 19, 2020', \"Terrific performances deliver an ailing separation case whereas egoism outweighs humanism as the argument proved solid points for and against one another, even though missing some pivotal information to further investigate. Meanwhile, it's adjunct to another plot the case has brought in as some sort of final test to finalize any indication in the morally complex direction. This is all surrounding the perspective of the young victim being most affected when dealing with the stress from the resulted strained hardship to see her parents in truer lights while also splitting her world into two. Sounds messy like any end of long marriage as it gets more complicated between moral and cultural values, but it was all handled very well in an organized fashion. (B+)\"], ['Sarath B', 'Mar 15, 2020', 'Intense and bitingly real.'], ['Lily20 R', 'Jan 05, 2020', \"While this film might seem slow and tedious to get through, I found myself unwilling to turn it off and was emotionally invested in every single character, something I don't find myself doing often. A Separation weaves a mystery that is entirely believable to fit in our world, and that makes it all the more compelling. This is a film that has really stuck with me, and creates empathy that I think many Americans today need to experience.\"], ['Brian B', 'Dec 01, 2019', \"*Spoiler Warning*I'm glad I went into this film without knowing much about the plot as, by the end, I was surprised at how so much more happened than what I thought would transpire from the film upon going into it. The basic outline involves a married couple, Nader and Simin, who wish to get a divorce as Simin wants to leave the country in hopes of finding a better life for their daughter while Nader prefers to stay and look after his father who has Alzheimer's disease. As I was watching it, I started to think that Nader's father would be better off in the hands of someone more qualified. But this was only the first quarter of the film. After this, the film got much darker once the crime angle took full effect. What I loved about it was that the conflict between the two families wasn't black-and-white. It was made clear that you weren't meant to completely agree with one side. Throughout the film, many of the main characters lied to the police and to each other, there were various characters who shifted from being likable to unlikable a handful of times, and there were also some choices made by characters which were inexcusable, regardless of what information was revealed at the end of the film. By the end, you're unsure over how you feel about the various characters, which is reflected well in the ambiguity of the final scene. Overall, I dug this film quite a lot, and I found it to be really effective from start to finish.\"], ['Cole W', 'Nov 12, 2019', 'A morally complex, engrossing, and well-acted drama.'], ['francisco t', 'Oct 09, 2019', \"This is one of the best movies i've ever seen.\"], ['Madhan B', 'Sep 23, 2019', 'A Separation is a story that starts simply enough as a domestic drama, but as things escalate it becomes much more. I always find it interesting when a film explores how mundane events can snowball into something serious, and this film shows a great example of the compounding effect one simple decision can create. I was riveted as the plot progressed because they managed to keep enough details from the viewers, so we never quite knew the truth. Eventually the film devolves into a prolonged legal battle, and even though the Iranian legal system is slightly different from our own, it still had all the excitement that I love out of courtroom dramas. In fact, there was some simplicity to this court proceeding that I found delightful. (Perhaps the absence of lawyers helps.) There were twists and turns, bold lies, and emotional pleas to the judge. This all made for a movie that worked much better for me than I expected after the slow setup in the early scenes. What I always find amazing is when a film is able to shift my opinions of the characters over time, without completely rewriting them. The personalities of the characters in A Separation never changed one bit, but each time something more would be revealed, I would reconsider how I felt about the people involved. There are no clear villains or heroes in this story, because it feels like real life. Instead, each character is doing what they think is right, and whether they are actually in the right or in the wrong is in the eye of the beholder. There are several aspects of this movie that are tough to watch, though. It prominently features an old man struggling with Alzheimer’s, which I’ve experienced firsthand and I don’t enjoy reliving it. The ending is also a real gut punch, and sadly left me hanging instead of giving me the closure I typically prefer. However, all-around I think that A Separation is a wonderfully constructed film, and one that more people should seek out.'], ['Caroline C', 'Jul 13, 2019', 'What a great movie!  How does the director make you feel sympathetic towards each character?  How do we judge others - law, religion, personal experience, morals?  How do our decisions affect others?

The dialogue is what carries it in my opinion.'], ['Matt C', 'Sep 12, 2018', 'This Iranian import is an absolutely powerful tale of domestic drama, where every character is completely justified in his or her actions and also completely wrong.

Issues like class and gender become all-powerful as an absurd, unnecessary tragedy unfolds step by step, peppered by little lies and difficult circumstances. The film is relentless, as every detail matters, and one thing leads to another with tragic fatality.'], ['Yannis A', 'Jan 08, 2018', \"Finally got around to watching this and it was really worth the wait, my wife got drawn in as well and ended up watching the whole movie as well which is some trick for a subtitled Iranian film to pull off!  It just feels so real, it bring to mind travelling in similar countries and the characters and relationships are all believable.  This isn't a film where you end up picking sides because everyone's actions and motivations are complicated just like in real life, it's a slice of life.

It was also really interesting watching this film as a foreigner.  I am a Westerner, but it was really intriguing watching a film set against an Islamic background.

Das Gesetz versucht, hypothetisch zu richten und dabei besteht die Gefahr, dass das Recht durch Prinzipien ersetzt wird. Und so funktioniert die Grundkonstellation: Nader und Simin (Peyman Moadi und Leila Hatami) sind ein glücklich verheiratetes Ehepaar aus Teheran mit einer süssen elfjährigen Tochter namens Termeh (Sarina Farhadi). Ausserdem lebt Naders siniler Vater bei ihnen. Um ihrer Tochter ein besseres Leben zu ermöglichen, wollen Nader und Simin auswandern. Nader will nur noch eine Weile bleiben, um für den Vater zu sorgen. Ein Konflikt: Sein Vater würde ihn doch gar nicht mehr kennen; sagt Simin. Nader aber widerspricht, dass er seinen Vater dagegen sehr wohl noch kennen würde. Für den Vater hat Nader eine Pflegerin engagiert, Razieh (Sareh Bayat). Sie arbeitet im Geheimen, da ihr Mann Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini), niemals erlauben würde, dass sie in einem Haushalt arbeitet, in dem sie mit einem Mann allein ist. Ein strikter Moslem offensichtlich. Eines Tages kehrt Nader heim und findet seinen Vater ans Bett gefesselt. Razieh tat das aus gutem Grund, doch in diesem Moment wissen weder Nader noch wir das. Nader feuert Razieh und sie beschuldigt ihn, dass er sie die Treppe herunter stiess. Dabei erlitt sie eine Fehlgeburt. Nader wird des Totschlags angeklagt. Ich denke, das ist alles, was du über die Ausgangssituation wissen musst. Der Richter agiert übrigens fair in diesem Prozess und auch die Geschworenen versuchen, möglichst objektiv zu entscheiden. Niemand im Gerichtssaal aber, kennt alle Fakten und das Urteil muss gemäss des Korans ausfallen. Nader und Simin sind moderaten Glaubens, Razieh überlegt immerhin, ob sie die Unterwäsche eines Mannes wechseln darf, obwohl der alt und krank ist. Die treibende Kraft hinter ihr, das ist ihre Familie. Ich denke, wir haben es hier weniger mit einem Gerichtsfilm zu tun, der die Wahrheitsfindung zum Ziel hat. A Seperation versucht vielmehr, alle Seiten zu verstehen und Empathie aufzubauen. Im Mittelpunkt stehen Liebende, deren Handeln sie entweit. Es fällt uns am Ende schwer, überhaupt wen zu verurteilen. Ich hatte die grössten Probleme, Naders Position zu teilen. Ja, ich verstehe ihn. Nein, ich denke, er handelt falsch, weil er immer noch in den Kategorien Recht vs. Unrecht operiert - das aber auf Kosten seiner Familie. Ich denke, in den Zeiten von Pergida und Trump, in denen die dümmsten Menschen davon ausgehen, der Iran sei eine Nation voller durchgedrehter \"Kameltreiber\", ist A Seperation eine vernünftige Medizin. Wir bekommen das Portrait einer Gesellschaft in all ihren Nuancen. Die Menschen im Film agieren moderat mit dem Willen, das Richtige zu tun. Richtig und falsch zu entscheiden, das gestaltet sich hier zu einem moralischen Befund über das Wesen des Gerichts an sich.(Dazu gibts unsere Film List Arthaus Iran auf cinegeek.de'], ['Rameshwar I', 'Apr 22, 2016', \"So simple a premise envelopes such a complex plot. The fact that it is already overwhelming to see the usually under-the-wraps domestic life of Iran and to couple it with near perfect screenplay, performances and mounting suspense is more than what you can ask for and nothing you would have expected. Doing the right thing, setting an example, moral ambiguity, people's reaction to different circumstances were so beautifully fit into this complex puzzle. Payman Maadi (Nader) and Leila Hatami (Simin) are a couple going through a divorce after 14 years of marriage. While the reasons could be complicated and ambiguous, it is taking a toll on their teenage daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) and Nader's father who is suffering from Alzheimer's and requires constant care and attention. When he employs Razieh (Sareh Bayat) for household work, an incident triggers aggression from Nader who unconsciously acts rude to Razieh. Nader's life crumbles into further shambles when Razieh's family accuses and lodges a case on him for murder as she has suffered a miscarriage. When Razieh's husband Hojjat (Shahab Hosseini), an unemployed, depressed and debt ridden man takes matters to his hand, things turn ugly. The beauty of it is the realistic approach taken in every frame resisting the temptations of being sensational. The screenplay was so exhilarating pushing the boundaries of such a simple premise into heart-pounding suspense. The ideology, the general mindset and day-to-day life in Iran was quite informative and fulfills your food for curiosity. Coming to performances, it is near perfect with none tampering into each other's space and doing the best in their zone. A special mention should go to the sweet little girl who plays Razieh's daughter as she conveys a lot through her big expressive eyes and hardly uttering a word. While the divorce story as advertised plays a poignant role, it mostly takes a backseat during the tense drama. Some scenes that were informative or packs an impact > When Razieh calls a religious helpline to check if she could change a helpless old man's pants > Razieh's daughter's eyes conveying and covering the facade of ugly spats > When Teremeh confronts Nader if he lied > Climax tussle between Razieh and Hojjat > Nader's unflinching love and support for his father So simple a premise envelopes such a complex plot\"], ['Conrad T', 'Apr 16, 2016', 'A glimpse of the Iranian(Persian) humanity told through a very good story about a couple getting into a divorce fight.  The leading Iranian actress was unexpectedly beautiful.  There was an unanswered question - why did the wife so desperately want to leave the country ?'], ['Lân T', 'Apr 14, 2016', 'What a film! Hands down'], ['John G', 'Mar 12, 2016', \"A Separation is an absolute tour-de-force of storytelling. Long after the credits have rolled, I still have hard time comprehending how writer/director Asghar Farhadi managed to fit so much into just two hours. The film touches on a number of potentially melodramatic issues with real clarity and poise, and the cultural differences between the characters and us just enhance our interest in what's happening to them. It's a masterful piece of filmmaking, and one that'll stay with you for a while.Nader (Peyman Maadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) are our main characters, and they've decided to get a divorce. Simin wishes to move to America to give their only daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), more opportunities than she'll be afforded in their native Iran. Nader, however, won't go. His father was recently stricken with Alzheimer's and he's obligated to care for him. Though these two are generally agreeable and relatively forward-thinking, this issue wedges them apart in seemingly irreparable ways.But it's the aftermath of this separation that moves the film forward. A now single Nader hires a woman, Razieh (Sareh Bayat), to care for his father during the day. She does it for one day but has number of issues with the arrangement. She travels a long way to do it, and she's forced to take Nader's father to the bathroom (which makes her, a married woman, uncomfortable). But the biggest complication is that she's pregnant and her husband, Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini), doesn't know she's working in the home of another man.One day, Nader returns home early to find Razieh gone, some money missing, and his father passed out and tied to the bed. When the woman gets in, he's understandably furious. She needed to run an errand, she says. But the ensuing shouting match ends with Nader shoving her (somewhat gently) out the door. She falls down the stairs, and the next day, Nader is arrested. Murder is the charge, for Razieh lost her baby, and the two families take their extraordinarily complicated problems to the Iranian courts.Yes, A Separation is quite dense. There's a lot of set-up necessary for the viewer to understand the relationships and how the consequences of both the separation and the confrontation will reverberate throughout this small group of people. Will this little shove mean Termeh and her mother end up in America? Could Razieh also go to jail (for negligence)? Her husband (for insolence)? Then, there's the questions about the real cause of the termination of Razieh's pregnancy. Where exactly did she go that day? And could her husband's very short temper have caused him to abuse her after finding out about her work? These would have been incredibly complex issues and questions in, say, an American suburban drama. In the hectic, overcrowded Iranian courts, the film takes on a whole other level of confusion and complexity. In this way, Tehran is itself one of the most important characters in this story.It should come as no surprise that a film like this (and one that's been so universally praised) features extraordinary acting. Of all the great, authentic performances (and there are many), I think Peyman Maadi's is the strongest. Overall, he's a good man. He's struggling to do the best he can after being thrown for a loop when his wife leaves him, and this pressure causes him to make one mistake. And he's trying to show his daughter what's right and what's wrong, but then he chooses to lie to the judge in order to protect himself. The film ultimately comes down to deciding to do what's right and what's easy. This question is embodied most in Nader, and Maddi does an astounding job bringing his character's struggle with it to life.A Separation has been acknowledged by countless critics groups and is a frontrunner to earn an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign-Language Feature. It deserves all of this attention, and more. It's a relatively accessible motion picture, though general audiences are, of course, subtitle-phobic. I hope it gets an audience, for it's a film that deserves robust discussion and debate.http://www.johnlikesmovies.com/a-separation-review/\"], ['Emily A', 'Dec 15, 2015', \"It's pretty supernatural how well this depicts the pain of being silent and caught between moral conflicts where no side is justified.

It's basically Nader (Moaadi) trying to keep his family together as he cares for his senile father, but his wife, Simin (Hatami) wants to abandon him & her daughter for some reason. The real female lead is the poor maid, Razieh (Bayat), who - like Nader - is just trying to make ends meet, but when an altercation ends badly, it turns into a story of poor courtroom 'he said/she said' drama, with truths slowly being revealed over the next two hours.

The casting was great, and the plot had a nice twist at the end. Which made the story even more poignant.
